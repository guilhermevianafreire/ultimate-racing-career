# Ultimate Racing Career

Simulate a racing career starting from the lowest entry points of racing to the most prestigious ones. It can be used integrated to a racing simulator or by manually inputting the results on the application. The career will not be limited by a single racing simulator, so that each championship available could be played on a different racing simulator.
